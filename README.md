## 🎯 How It Works

### 📤 Image Upload Flow
1. User uploads image via drag-and-drop or file picker
2. Original image displays in left panel with file size
3. Compression automatically processes the image
4. Compressed preview appears in right panel with new file size
5. Real-time updates as quality slider is adjusted

### ⚙️ Compression Process
1. **File Reading**: FileReader API converts image to base64
2. **Canvas Drawing**: Image is drawn on HTML5 Canvas element
3. **Quality Adjustment**: Canvas exports with user-defined JPEG quality
4. **Blob Creation**: Compressed image converted to downloadable blob
5. **Preview Generation**: URL created for instant visual feedback

### 🎚️ Quality Control
1. Adjust slider from 10% (maximum compression) to 100% (minimal compression)
2. Live preview updates automatically with debouncing
3. File size recalculates instantly
4. Savings percentage displayed in real-time
5. Download compressed image at any quality level
